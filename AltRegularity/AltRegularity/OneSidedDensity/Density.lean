# AltRegularity.OneSidedDensity.Density

Density from one-sided almost minimality (Lemma 5.8 in the paper).

If a sequence of sets of finite perimeter $\Omega_i$ is uniformly one-sided
$\varepsilon$-almost area-minimizing on a ball $B_R(p)$ for $\varepsilon$
sufficiently small, and the boundaries $|\partial^* \Omega_i|$ converge
as varifolds to $V$, then the limit varifold has positive density at $p$.

/-- **Density from one-sided almost minimality (Lemma 5.8).**
Given $|\partial^*\Omega_i| \to V$ with each $\Omega_i$ uniformly one-sided
$\varepsilon$-almost minimizing in $B_R(p)$ for sufficiently small $\varepsilon$,
the limit varifold has $\Theta(\|V\|, p) > 0$. -/
